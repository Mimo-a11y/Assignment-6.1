# Car Evaluation Classification — Activities 4.01 & 4.02

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks completed for the course assignment:

- `Activity4.01.ipynb` — Decision Tree Classification (classifies cars into `unacceptable`, `acceptable`, `good`, `very good`)
- `Activity4.02.ipynb` — Random Forest and Extra Trees (ensemble) Classification for optimization and comparison

## Overview

The goal is to help a car rental company predict which cars clients are likely to buy or prefer.  
Both notebooks include: data loading, preprocessing (label encoding), model training, evaluation (classification report and confusion matrix), and feature importance extraction.

## Files
- `Activity4_01.ipynb` — Decision tree model, evaluation, and notes.
- `Activity4_02.ipynb` — Random Forest & Extra Trees models, comparative evaluation, and feature importance.
